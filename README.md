# What are Data Structures in Java?
The way that data is organized and stored in a computer program's memory relies closely on Java records structures. The Java well-known library includes a significant type of built-in statistics structures. A few of the records systems that permit programmers short and simple ways to save and arrange data include connected lists, stacks, queues, and arrays. Developers can quickly perform operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and sorting because they provide a range of mechanisms for getting Access to, altering, and managing data. Java programmers can reduce memory use and considerably boost the overall efficiency of their programs by using these data structures.
